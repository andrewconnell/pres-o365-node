Presentations
-------------

- **[Running Office 365 apps on a Raspberry Pi 2 with AzureAD & Node.js](pres-raspberrypi.md)**	

	In this little 15 minute express talk, I showed how you can use a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B to run a Node.js website that authenticates with AzureAD & consumes the Office 365 APIs. Interested in learning more, getting the code & checking out the demo video?

- **[Building Office Add-ins using Node.js](pres-officeaddins-nodejs.md)**

	Andrew Connell will show you how to build a web application using Node.JS. This session will walk you through the steps to get started with Node.JS and the plumbing needed for Apps for Office. They will show how to build Apps for Office in both Outlook and Excel that talk to the Office.JS. End to end solutions will be used to show the power of the App Model for the End Users who never have to leave the product they live and breathe in to surface more business context than ever before.

- **[Building Business Apps Like they do in the Valley with Angular, Node.js and more](pres-node-angular-valley.md)**

	This session is a deep dive journey into using third party Angular, Node.js, or any other third-party library to create apps.

Demos
-----
- **[officeaddin-outlook - Office Add-in for Outlook using Node.js & Angular](officeaddin-outlook)**

	This sample demonstrates how to create an Office Add-in for Outlook using non-Microsoft technologies. Office Add-ins are web applications that are referenced by the hosting Office client application. In this sample the web application is implemented as an [Angular 1.3.x](http://angularjs.org) application with two views that calls a server side WebAPI implemented [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org). All JavaScript in this sample is written using [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org). 

- **[node-o365-web - Node.js Website with AzureAD & Office 365 Integration](node-o365-web)**

	This sample demonstrates how to create a website using [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) that authenticates with AzureAD & Office 365 using REST APIs. In this sample the website is bare-bones... implemented as an MVC style site using Handlebars as the view engine. All JavaScript in this sample is written using [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org).
